Code for the PiWars 2019 badge

## BadgeSnake
A minimal snake game.  Buttons 0 and 3 steer the snake, which grows and starts moving faster over time.  Eating food is #TODO, not implemented yet

## BadgeMaze
A simple maze based on the Canyons of Mars challenge.  Buttons move left/down/up/right. Challenge for the keen: make a scrolling viewport that would allow mazes bigger than 5x5!

## SoundBadge
Two modes to make spacy sound effects with a hacked analog synth kit.  Mode 1 displays a running graph of light sensor readings on the badge screen, which could be useful for some other purposes.

## POVBadge
For displaying messages via persistence of vision.  Swing the badge through the air and press one of the buttons for messages.  Would look pretty neat on a bike wheel (the only hard part is pressing the button every revolution)
