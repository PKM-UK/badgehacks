Code for the PiWars 2019 badge

## BadgeSnake
A minimal snake game.  Buttons 0 and 3 steer the snake, which grows and starts moving faster over time.  Eating food is #TODO, not implemented yet

## BadgeMaze
A simple maze based on the Canyons of Mars challenge.  Buttons move left/down/up/right. Challenge for the keen: make a scrolling viewport that would allow mazes bigger than 5x5!
